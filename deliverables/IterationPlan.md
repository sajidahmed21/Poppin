# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME
Team WIP

## Iteration 01

 * Start date: October 11, 5:30 - 7:00
 * End date: October 16

## Process

(Optional:) Introduction

#### Roles & responsibilities

Describe the different roles (e.g. developers, communication facilitator,
proof-reader, etc.) on the team, and the responsibilities associated with each role.

Noah - 
Andy - 
Sajid - will be taking and uploading meeting notes
Kenneth -
Darshan -
Anshay - 

#### Events

Please describe the meetings you planning to have:


We will be meeting at least once a week to discuss any issues or blockers we are encountering, as well as our current progress on what we are working on individually. These meetings will be held online.


In addition to this, we will also review our overall progress on our eventual goal of producing a minimum viable product. The goal of this would be to decide whether any changes to our plans need to be made to accommodate to changing circumstances as we move forward in our project.

#### Artifacts

Please describe the artifacts that you will produce in order to organize and keep track of your team's progress.       
For example:
 * To-do lists, burndown chart, schedule, etc.
 * If you include charts/diagrams, make sure to explain what they represent.
 * If you're maintaining a to-do list, make sure to mention which tool you're using, how you are prioritizing items and how items get assigned to team members.


We will be using GitHub Issues to keep track of all our tasks including bug, story, development and QA tickets.

More specifically we will post “.md” files in our GitHub repositories which will contain:
Minutes from weekly team meetings
Task Assignment Lists decided upon in the meetings
UML Diagrams and other diagrams/tools to help with the design of our product



## Product

Goals and tasks:

 * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 * When listing goals/tasks, order the items from most to least important.
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.


For this iteration, the most important goal is to brainstorm and finalize an idea that we can all agree on and is realistic enough given the time we have to work on it. This includes discussing the many features we may implement into our product, the platform we are using, and what each individual is capable of doing (frontend, backend, etc). 

In addition to this, our next most important goal is to finish the first team deliverable.

Order of Importance:
Brainstorm and Finalize on idea for product. Sub tasks are:
Discuss problems/needs the product will address
Discuss features that need to be implemented in order to achieve this
Discuss possible technologies that could be used to implement the minimal viable product
Discuss appropriate roles for team members according to their different skill sets
Work on team deliverable


Artifacts

 * Describe the artifacts (diagrams, interactive mock-ups, wireframes, actual code, etc.)
   that you are planning to produce by the end of (and during) this iteration.
 * Be precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.

For this iteration, we are planning to create mock-up diagrams of different app screens? To demonstrate the planned functionality of our planned product. ……...
