Team 16

## Iteration 01

 * Start date: October 11, 5:30pm - 7:00pm
 * End date: October 21

## Process

### Roles & Responsibilities

Noah: Define and describe the product including its target user base as a part of the `product.md` file to be submitted for Deliverable 1; Create preliminary wireframes for the application.

Anshay: Create digital UI screen mockups that illustrate the look and feel of the key features of the app.

Sajid: Document discussions and work progress through taking meeting notes; Define meeting agendas prior to meetings; Document the roles and responsibilities of team members in `iteration.md`.

Kenneth: Create a preliminary and high-level database schema for the application.

Andy: Document the goals and tasks of this iteration as a part of `iteration.md`.

Darshan: Document and explain the work process, methods of communication, and other artifacts that we plan to use in our project.

### Events

We will be meeting on a weekly basis, mainly online through the use of
Google Hangout and Slack in order to keep each other up-to-date on our overall
progress, and to ensure we are all on-track to complete each deliverable,
according to our application's design plans and specifications.

At each meeting, every team member will update his fellow teammates on his
progress, any roadblocks or difficulties he is having, and will define
"actionable" items he will pursue and complete for our next meeting / deliverable.

Notes for each meeting will be maintained, detailing key points of discussion,
as well as a collection of all "actionable" items and important dates.

We will plan these weekly meetings with contingency plans in case unforeseeable
circumstances cause a particular meeting to be delayed.

### Artifacts

We will be using GitHub Issues to keep track of all our tasks including bug, story, development and QA tickets.

More specifically, we will post ".md" files to our team repository which will contain:
 * Minutes from weekly team meetings.
 * Task Assignment Lists ("actionable" items) decided upon during each meeting.
 * UML Diagrams and/or other diagrams and tools to help with the design and implementation of our product.

## Product

### Goals and tasks:

For this iteration, the most important goal is to brainstorm and finalize an idea that we can all agree on and is realistic enough given the time we have to work on it. This includes discussing the many features we may implement into our product, the platform we are using, and what each individual is capable of doing (frontend, backend, etc).

In addition to this, our next most important goal is to finish the first team deliverable.

#### Order of Importance:

 * Brainstorm and Finalize on idea for product. Sub tasks are:
   * Discuss problems/needs the product will address
   * Discuss features that need to be implemented in order to achieve this
   * Discuss possible technologies that could be used to implement the minimal viable product
   * Discuss appropriate roles for team members according to their different skill sets
   * Work on team deliverable

### Artifacts

For this iteration, we are planning to create mock-up diagrams of our possible key pages, which would be used to display hypothetical UI elements, to demonstrate the planned functionality of our product. In addition to this, it will allow everyone to succinctly identify not only any UX issues that may not be immediately apparent but to also makes notes and charts of how the myriad of elements will potentially interact with one another such as outlining all the information we could possibly store, to the DBMS possibly required, to the resulting views of various users.
