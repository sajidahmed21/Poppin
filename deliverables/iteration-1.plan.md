## Iteration 01

 * Start date: October 11, 5:30pm - 7:00pm
 * End date: October 21

## Process

### Roles & Responsibilities

Noah: Define and describe the product, including its target user base, as a part of the `product.md` file to be submitted for Deliverable 1; Create preliminary wireframes for the application.

Anshay: Create digital UI screen mockups that illustrate the look and feel of the key features of the app.

Sajid: Document discussions and work progress through taking meeting notes; Define meeting agendas prior to meetings; Document the roles and responsibilities of team members in `iteration.md`.

Kenneth: Create a preliminary and high-level database schema for the application.

Andy: Document the goals and tasks of this iteration as a part of `iteration.md`.

Darshan: Document and explain the work process, methods of communication, and other artifacts that we plan to use in our project.

### Events

We will be meeting on a weekly basis, mainly online through the use of
Google Hangout and Slack in order to keep each other up-to-date on our overall
progress, and to ensure we are all on-track to complete each deliverable,
according to our application's design plans and specifications.

At each meeting, every team member will update his fellow teammates on his
progress, any roadblocks or difficulties he is having, and will define
"actionable" items he will pursue and complete for our next meeting / deliverable.

Notes for each meeting will be maintained, detailing key points of discussion,
as well as a collection of all "actionable" items and important dates.

We will plan these weekly meetings with contingency plans in case unforeseeable
circumstances cause a particular meeting to be delayed.

### Artifacts

We will be using GitHub Issues to keep track of all our tasks including bug, story, development and QA tickets.

More specifically, we will post ".md" files to our team repository which will contain:
 * Minutes from weekly team meetings.
 * Task Assignment Lists ("actionable" items) decided upon during each meeting.
 * UML Diagrams and/or other diagrams and tools to help with the design and implementation of our product.

## Product

### Goals and tasks:

The primary goal of this iteration is to brainstorm and finalize an idea that we all agree on and that is realistic enough given the time we have to implement it. Some of the tasks towards this goal include: identifying the needs of users that the product will address, discussing and finalizing the main features we want to implement in our product, identifying the platform(s) we are targeting,  and choosing a name for our product. While making the above decisions and as an important step towards our goal, we will be taking into account individual preferences and areas of comfort with respect to familiarity and experience with technologies (frontend, backend, known frameworks, etc).

In addition to this, our next most important goal is to complete the requirements for the first team deliverable. The preliminary tasks towards this goal is to precisely document our idea and the iteration plan. Later, at the end of our iteration, we will create a review document based on the tasks we have completed from the initial plan we made.

#### Order of Importance:

 * Brainstorm and Finalize an idea for the product. Tasks include:
   * Discuss and identify problems/needs the product will address
   * Discuss and finalize the features that need to be implemented in order to achieve this
   * Discuss possible technologies that could be used to implement the product
   * Discuss and identify appropriate roles for team members based on their their skill sets and preferences
   * Work on team deliverable


 * Complete Deliverable 1 Requirements. Tasks include:

  * Defining and describing the product, including its target user base, as a part of  `product.md`
  * Defining individual tasks towards our goal and documenting our iteration plan in `iteration.md`
  * Documenting what we did or did not complete based on what we planned initially, into `iteration-review.md`

### Artifacts

* Define the product; identify the user base.

* Create mock-up screens / wireframes for main features, which display the key UI elements also illustrate the expected flow of the application.

* Create a high-level design for the database schema for both the front and back-end.

* Complete each of `product.md`, `iteration-01.plan.md`, and `iteration-01.review.md` according to the given guidelines in the handout.
