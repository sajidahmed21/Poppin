## Iteration 01

 * Start date: October 11, 5:30pm - 7:00pm
 * End date: October 21

## Process

TODO: Introduction

### Roles & Responsibilities

Noah - Front end.

Anshay - Front end.

Sajid - Recording meeting minutes; Back end.

Kenneth - Back end; Database.

Andy - Back end.

Darshan - Back end.

### Events

We will be meeting at least once a week to discuss any issues or blockers we are encountering, as well as our current progress on what we are working on individually. These meetings will be held online (mainly using Google Hangout).

In addition to this, we will also review our overall progress on our eventual goal of producing a minimum viable product. The goal of this would be to decide whether any changes to our plans need to be made to accommodate to changing circumstances as we move forward in our project.

### Artifacts

We will be using GitHub Issues to keep track of all our tasks including bug, story, development and QA tickets.

More specifically, we will post ".md" "files in our GitHub repositories which will contain:
 * Minutes from weekly team meetings.
 * Task Assignment Lists decided upon in the meetings.
 * UML Diagrams and other diagrams/tools to help with the design of our product.

## Product

### Goals and tasks:

For this iteration, the most important goal is to brainstorm and finalize an idea that we can all agree on and is realistic enough given the time we have to work on it. This includes discussing the many features we may implement into our product, the platform we are using, and what each individual is capable of doing (frontend, backend, etc).

In addition to this, our next most important goal is to finish the first team deliverable.

#### Order of Importance:

 * Brainstorm and Finalize on idea for product. Sub tasks are:
   * Discuss problems/needs the product will address
   * Discuss features that need to be implemented in order to achieve this
   * Discuss possible technologies that could be used to implement the minimal viable product
   * Discuss appropriate roles for team members according to their different skill sets
   * Work on team deliverable

### Artifacts

For this iteration, we are planning to create mock-up diagrams of our possible key pages, which would be used to display hypothetical UI elements, to demonstrate the planned functionality of our product. In addition to this, it will allow everyone to succinctly identify not only any UX issues that may not be immediately apparent but to also makes notes and charts of how the myriad of elements will potentially interact with one another such as outlining all the information we could possibly store, to the DBMS possibly required, to the resulting views of various users.
