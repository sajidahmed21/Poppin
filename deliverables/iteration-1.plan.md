### Roles & Responsibilities

__Anshay (UI Designer)__: Create digital UI mockups that illustrate the look and feel of the key features of the app.

__Kenneth (Database Designer)__: Create a preliminary and high-level database schema for the application.

__Andy (Documenter)__: Document the goals and tasks of this iteration as a part of `iteration-01.plan.md`.

__Darshan (Documenter & Proof-Reader)__: Document and explain the work process, methods of communication, and other artifacts that we plan to use in our project.

### Events

We will be meeting on a weekly basis, primarily through Google Hangouts, to discuss our progress, address outstanding items, and share ideas. If required, we plan to meet more frequently, particularly in the early days of our iteration, till we finalize our project idea.

The agenda of every meeting will be mentioned in our Slack channel prior to the meeting, and will later be uploaded along with the meeting notes and action items in the [meeting notes](https://github.com/csc301-fall-2016/project-team-16/tree/master/meeting%20notes) folder in our Git repository.

While the agenda of meetings may vary, all meetings will primarily be focused on reviewing progress, identifying blockers, and assigning remaining tasks to team members.

### Artifacts

We will be using Slack as our primary mode of communication outside of meetings to notify each other as tasks get completed or some unexpected blockers / issues arise.

GitHub Issues is another tool we are considering to use if Slack does not prove to be very effective for tracking blockers / issues.

We target to keep track of progress and completed tasks by documenting the discussions and outcomes of our meetings. Tasks will get assigned to team members based on their preferences and their fair share of work. Notes from each team meeting will include the following:

 * Agenda (i.e. pending tasks, blockers, etc, to be addressed in the meeting)
 * Meeting Notes (i.e. discussions / suggestions and decisions made, if any)
 * Action Items (i.e. tasks to be completed before the next meeting)

## Product

### Goals and tasks:

The primary goal of this iteration is to brainstorm and finalize an idea that we all agree on and that is realistic enough given the time we have to implement it. Some of the tasks towards this goal include: identifying the needs of users that the product will address, discussing and finalizing the main features we want to implement in our product, identifying the platform(s) we are targeting,  and choosing a name for our product. While making the above decisions and as an important step towards our goal, we will be taking into account individual preferences and areas of comfort with respect to familiarity and experience with technologies (prior experience, known frameworks, etc).

In addition to this, our next most important goal is to complete the requirements for the first team deliverable. The preliminary tasks towards this goal is to precisely document our idea and the iteration plan. Later, at the end of our iteration, we will create a review document based on the tasks we have completed from the initial plan we made.

#### Order of Importance:

 * Brainstorm and Finalize an idea for the product. Tasks include:
   * Discuss and identify problems/needs the product will address
   * Discuss and finalize the features that need to be implemented in order to achieve this
   * Discuss possible technologies that could be used to implement the product
   * Discuss and identify appropriate roles for team members based on their their skill sets and preferences
   * Work on team deliverable


 * Complete Deliverable 1 Requirements. Tasks include:

  * Defining and describing the product, including its target user base, as a part of  `product.md`
  * Defining individual tasks towards our goal and documenting our iteration plan in `iteration-01.plan.md`
  * Documenting what we did or did not complete based on what we planned initially, into `iteration-01.review.md`

### Artifacts

* Define the product and identify the user base in a written form.

* Create digital mock-up screens / wireframes for main features, which display the key UI elements and also illustrate the expected flow of the application.

* Create a high-level design for the database schema for both the front and back-end.

* Complete each of `product.md`, `iteration-01.plan.md`, and `iteration-01.review.md` according to the given guidelines in the handout.
