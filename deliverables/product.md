# Poppin

#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

Events themselves are social in nature, and yet the way we organize events,
browse what's happening in the area, and decide on which event to attend,
is not social at all.

`Poppin` is a social network for events, enabling the end-user to discover
events in his/her vicinity which cater to his/her preferences. How we cater to
personal interests through the use of "communities" is the key factor
differentiating us from competitors.

The `Poppin` mobile application (iOS & Android) provides the end-user
with an interactive map and event listing, featuring all events within
traveling distance, providing a search and filters for __start time__,
__duration__, __size of event__, __event type__, __community__, __exclusivity__,
amongst other event features.

Users can click on an event they are interested in attending to see more
information, to see which of their friends are attending, and to chat with
users at the event or others who are also interested in attending.

##### Event Features

 * __start time / duration__: The date/time and length of the event. Events
 are sorted by "interest" (Are the events similar to past events you have
 attended? How many of your friends are going?) and by "date" (earliest first).
 * __size of event__: Small, Medium, Large, or if the event creator decides to
 release the information (consent checkbox), the actual number of users
 who have said they are attending with this app will be shown.
 * __max size__: The Event organizer can specify a max attendee size. If the maximum
 number of people RSVP to the event, the event will be "remove/hidden/marked as inactive".
 * __event type__: Preset choices. An event can be a party, a fundraiser,
 a hackathon, a networking event, a carnival, etc...
 * __price__: Free or $.
 * __incentive__: None or "Free Food" etc...
 * __community__: Being a social application, an event can be tagged as being
 a part of zero or more communities. A community can be a town, school, club,
 or organization.
 * __exclusivity__: Events can be public or private. Private events can be set
 to allow users who are "invited" by someone at the event, who are friends of
 the event organizer, or mutual friends of the event organizer. *Possibly*
 also allow exclusivity based on "communities" the user is a part of, thus
 making some communities "private" (by common email e.g. mail.utoronto.ca or
 by invite).

When the user signs up, they can connect their Facebook and/or Phone contacts
to sync "friends list". This enables the app to see the events that your friends
are attending.

##### Facebook Integration (optional)
In addition to seeing and interacting with events created through the app,
public Facebook events and Facebook events from a connected account will
also be shown. Their status as a "Facebook" event will be indicated.

_Optional_ feature which we may add if the opportunity presents itself after we've
completed the core of the application.

##### Event Chat
Users can chat with other users who are either interested in attending an event
or are already at an event. If the user at the event consents (by checking in
at the event), they will be indicated as "At The Event" in the chat next to
their name. This allows people interested in going to ask about exactly what is
occurring at the event and their opinions of the ongoings of the event.

#### Q2: Who are your target users?

We are targeting the existing user base of _EventBrite_, _Facebook Events_ and
other event services, with an emphasis on smaller social events. We will
not be handling tickets/payments (which _EventBrite_ does do).

There are two sides to this user base, the _Event Organizer_ and the _Event Attendee_.

More specifically, the _Event Attendee_ could be a hard working adult, wanting an excuse to catch up with some friends (or maybe even give them pleasant surprise!) after having spent a tad too much time at work. On the other side, a younger student that had just moved to a new area or town and wants to find out what activities and events are around. Definitely a newly met acquaintance could show you around but how could they know all your interests already? Heading to an event of your choice and size would be much more preferable.


#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem?

Currently, if an _Event Organizer_ wants to advertise for an event, he/she
will create an Event on _Facebook_ and/or _EventBrite_ (or other similar service).
At this point, the majority of the attendee demographic is from word of mouth,
and from _Facebook_'s "Suggested Events" algorithms which relies mostly on mutual
friends attending. Larger events may pay for additional advertising, either
through traditional advertising media or by "boosting" their _Facebook_ posts.

On the other side of the coin, an _Event Attendee_ will see an advertisement
for an event, hear about an event via word of mouth, or possibly browse events
on _EventBrite_ (mainly limited to larger events).

###### Spur of the Moment

It's 6pm on a Saturday night and John (an _Event Attendee_) is bored. He wants to
go out and do something. He opens his favourite event app and after the laborious task
of filtering by location, interest, date and time, he finds an event which seems interesting.
He wants to find out what the event is like, however he doesn't know anyone attending. He
really doesn't want to risk going to a boring event, so he stays home and watches Netflix.

What if John could chat live to someone at the event? What if he could interact with other
_Event Attendee's_?

Now consider the other side. An environmental club at UofT decides to hold
a small meeting to discuss the state of the environment and climate change. It
is unlikely that a Facebook Event will be made, considering time is pressing and
Facebook events take time to reach an audience (what would be the point?). The club
instead posts a status update on Facebook, it reaches some of the event organizer's
mutual friends, but that's the extent of its reach. They really should have planned
the event in advance.

What if the UofT club could post the event on an event discovery network,
immediately reaching all those who are interested? Reaching all those "subscribed"
to the "UofT" + "Environment" communities?

Our product provides the __solution__ to the problems facing __"spur of the moment"__
events, to reaching the right demographic, to quickly making and managing events and gatherings.
We provide the social component, which makes discovering events, and inquiring
about events fast and easy.

###### Communities

The core of our app is our communities. Communities can be exclusive to a group
of friends, or open to everyone. Communities are centered around a common
interest, activity, locale, or organization. Users join communities they find
interesting so that future events can be catered to their interests.

No existing service has this concept targeted towards events. `Meetup.com`,
an app with a similar __spur of the moment__ functionality, allows users to form
and join Meetup Groups, which are run as online organizations, whose sole purpose
it to create and facilitate common interest events. Rather than have users join
specific "organizations" (or Meetup Groups), we give users the freedom to specify
their interests, through communities of similar tastes. This enables our
application to serve targeted content, instead of relying on the well maintenance
of individual "groups".

In addition, rather than targeting "recurring" meetups, our focus is to provide
a platform for the one time event (although nothing stops a user from creating
two consecutive events with the same community tags).

> There is no service out on the market now which allows the same flexibility that
our app will provide, with the same level of social comfort, the same level
of customization (communities), and with the same level of ease. And yet, we have
all encountered situations where we wish we had some way to quickly announce
the presence of an event we made (as an Event Organizer) or to discover what's
happening in the city on a Saturday night.

Our product is solely a mobile application, as the nature of our application
(social, community based, quick & easy, "the moment") works well with the mobile platform. From a purely practical standpoint, especially for this course,
we will be limiting our scope, goals, and will keep our vision realistic and focused.
