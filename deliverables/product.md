#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

Events themselves are social in nature, and yet the way we organize events,
browse what's happening in the area, and decide on which event to attend,
is not social at all.

`PRODUCT` is a social network for events, enabling the end-user to discover
events in his/her vicinity which cater to his/her preferences.

The `PRODUCT` mobile application (iOS & Android) provides the end-user
with an interactive map and event listing, featuring all events within
traveling distance, providing a search and filters for __start time__,
__duration__, __size of event__, __event type__, __community__, __exclusivity__,
amongst other event features.

Users can click an event they are interested in attending to see more
information, to see which of their friends are attending, and to chat with
other user's at the event or who themselves are interested in attending.

##### Event Features

 * __start time / duration__: The date/time and length of the event. Events
 are sorted by "interest" (Are the events similar to past events you have
 attended? How many of your friends are going?) and by "date" (earliest first).
 * __size of event__: Small, Medium, Large, or if the event creator decides to
 release the information (consent checkbox), the actual number of users
 who have said they are attending with this app will be shown.
 * __event type__: Preset choices. An event can be a party, a fundraiser,
 a hackathon, a networking event, a carnival, etc...
 * __price__: Free or $.
 * __incentive__: None or "Free Food" etc...
 * __community__: Being a social application, an event can be tagged as being
 a part of zero or more communities. A community can be a town, school, club,
 or organization.
 * __exclusivity__: Events can be public or private. Private events can be set
 to allow users who are "invited" by someone at the event, who are friends of
 the event organizer, or mutual friends of the event organizer. *Possibly*
 also allow exclusivity based on "communities" the user is a part of, thus
 making some communities "private" (by common email e.g. mail.utoronto.ca or
 by invite).

When the user signs up, they can connect their Facebook and/or Phone contacts
to sync "friends list". This enables the app to see events where friends are
attending.

##### Facebook Integration
In addition to seeing and interacting with events created through the app,
public Facebook events and Facebook events from a connected account will
also be shown. Their status as a "Facebook" event will be indicated.

##### Event Chat
Users can chat with other users who are either interested in attending an event
or are already at an event. If the user at the event consents (by checking in
at the event), they will be indicated as "At The Event" in the chat next to
their name. This allows people interested in going to ask about what the event
is like.

#### Q2: Who are your target users?

We are targeting the existing user base of _EventBrite_, _Facebook Events_ and
other event services, with an emphasis on smaller social events. We will
not be handling tickets/payments (which _EventBrite_ does do).

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem?

YOUR ANSWER GOES HERE ...

 * Short (3 min' read max)
 * Essentially, we want you to "connect the dots" for us - Why does your product (as described in your answer to Q1) fits the needs of your users (as described in your answer to Q2)?
 * Highlight significant prodcut decisions that you've made:
    * Mention which alternatives you were considering.
    * Explain why the option you decided on makes the most sense for your product/users.
