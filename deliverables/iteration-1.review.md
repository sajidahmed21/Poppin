## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: October 24-25, 2016
 * Where: Initially in tutorial room, after tutorial, continued over Slack.

## Process - Reflection

Decisions turned out well:

 * Creating an initial mock-up allowed everyone to concretely see and understand the general flow and functionality of the application.

Decisions did not turn out as well as you hoped:

 * Managing our weekly meetings has been _challenging_, as everyone has conflicting
 schedules, although we've managed to make it work to some degree, especially by
 extending meetings which start on Google Hangout and extend into Slack.

We are planning to make the following changes to our process:

 * Ensure each meeting is more compact, to answer any lingering questions and concerns,
 rather than rely on Slack follow-up communications (although we will continue to
 to have follow-up discussions).

## Product - Review

Goals/tasks that were met/completed:

 * The most obvious and important one, having a product idea __finalized__.
 * Validated the above by successfully identifying a solution to the identified problem and target audience.
 * Summarized a list of main/wanted features in the application (in [product.md](product.md))
 * Created a mock-up of the design/UI of our application ([ui_mockups_v1_a.jpg](designs/ui_mockups_v1_a.jpg) and [ui_mockups_v1_b.jpg](designs/ui_mockups_v1_b.jpg))
 * Technologies to use, for example, as shown in the [schema_design_v1.md](designs/schema_design_v1.md) to use a DBMS.
 * Established a (possibly tentative) process for meeting minutes, documenting, and planning.


Goals/tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * We've discussed some technologies to be used but haven't ironed out details,
   although we've had discussion over Slack.

(Optional) Goals/tasks that were not originally planned, but ended up being not met/completed:

 * Decided on roles / division of technology stack for actual development.
   This has mainly been in Slack, and is not included in the first deliverable
   (although history of [iteration-1.plan](iteration-1.plan.md) will show evidence of this).

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * Enforce stricter timelines and check-ins.
 * Will look into making Slack more transparent; sometimes discussions become buried.
