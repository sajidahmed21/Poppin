# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

 * When: October 23 & 25, 2016 (Twice)
 * Where: Google Hangouts

## Process - Reflection

Decisions that turned out well include:

 * Use of Slack channels proved to be quite effective for both one-to-one and group communication. It allowed us to notify each other instantly about task completions or blockers. We also had a very healthy and argumentative discussion on Slack while brainstorming for project ideas, which was based on constructive criticism, feedback, and knowledge of prior existence of products.

 * Although not planned initially, itegrating GitHub with our primary Slack channel turned out to be very useful, as it gave everyone instant visibility into each others work / progress.

 * Although it has been challenging to manage the weekly meetings due to the reasons described below, the idea of holding online meetings, instead of physically meeting up, saved us significant amount of time, and offered us a bit of increased fleixibility in terms of scheduling future meetings.


Decisions that did not turn out pretty well include:

 * Not properly listing (or identifying) the different sources / ways to check for prior existence of similar applications has turned out be a bit frustrating. Google searches often did not reveal such similar applications, possbile due to their low popularity and / or cusomtomization of search results, amongst many other reasons.

We therefore, came up with a couple of ideas and were on the verge of finalizing them, before we were informed about the existence of similar applications by our TA (Adam).

 * Managing our weekly meetings has been challenging, as everyone has conflicting schedules, although we've managed to make it work to some degree, especially by extending meetings which start on Google Hangout and extend into Slack.

We are planning to make the following changes to our process:

 * Ensure each meeting is more compact, to answer any lingering questions and concerns, rather than rely on Slack follow-up communications (although we will continue to to have follow-up discussions).

 * Assign and enforce deadlines for tasks more strictly to ensure smooth progress throughout the iteration.


## Product - Review

Goals/tasks that were met/completed:

 * The most obvious and important one, having a product idea finalized.
 * Validated the above by successfully identifying a solution to the identified problem and target audience.
 * Summarized a list of main/wanted features in the application (in product.md)
 * Created a mock-up of the design/UI of our application (ui_mockups.png (various))
 * Technologies to use, for example, as shown in the schema_design_v1.md to use a DBMS.
