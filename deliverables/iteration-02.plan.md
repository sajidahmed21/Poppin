## Process

### Roles & Responsibilities


__Noah (Front-end Developer - UI and RESTful API Integration)__: 

* Setting up Cordova project for client-side development.

* Developing the following screens, which exhibit the primary features of our application.

__Anshay (Front-end Developer - UI)__:

* Setting up dev environment on local machine and becoming familiar with UI development using Cordova.

   * Create Event - which allows the user to create an event. Inputs include the same set of attributes as in the _Event Details_ page listed above.

__Sajid (Back-end Developer and Facilitator)__:

 * Setting up the server side project. This includes:
   * Adding the necessary dependencies
   * Creating separate components for user-related, event-related, and community-related web APIs.
   * Setting up connectivity with database server and creating SQL scripts based on the [schema design](designs/schema_design_v1.md).

 * Documenting RESTful APIs in a separate folder in Git repository

 * Implementing the SigIn / SignUp RESTful APIs

 * Documenting meeting discussions through taking proper [meeting notes](https://github.com/csc301-fall-2016/project-team-16/tree/master/meeting%20notes)

__Darshan (Back-end Developer - Business Logic and Computation)__:

 * Implementing the GetEvents RESTful API, initially using mock data (with no database connectivity), and later on using actual data stored in the database.

__Kenneth (Backend Developer - Database Engineer)__:

 * Implementing the GetEventDetals RESTful API, initially using mock data (with no database connectivity), and later on using actual data from the database.

 * Creating the database module which will wrap all database operations in a single component.

__Andy (Backend Developer - Business Logic and Computation)__:

 * Implementing the CreateEvent RESTful API, intially using mock data (with no database connectivity), and later on using actual data from the database.

       * Create and finalize a complete iteration plan

* Wednesday - November 2, 2016
      * Ensure Sign In and Sign Up screens are implemented.
      * Ensure server side project is set up and everyone can run the server on their local machine.
* Saturday - November 5, 2016
     * Verify whether _Discover_ (i.e. home) screen has been implemented.
     * Verify whether SignUp, CreateEvent, GetNearbyEvents, and GetEventDetails RESTful APIs are implemented properly using mock data.
     * Discuss any changes that need to be made to the UI or the RESTful APIs.
* Tuesday - November 8, 2016
       * Ensure any pending or re-assigned tasks from last meeting has been completed.
       * Ensure the remaining screens in the client application has been implemented.

### Artifacts

Tasks will be assigned based on priority and individual preferences / skill sets. We will granularize tasks during team meetings, which will then be formally defined and assigned to team members using GitHub Issues.

In order to better prioritize tasks and track progress, we have decided to integrate [Waffle](https://waffle.io) as our project management tool.

While Waffle will organize our GitHub Issues as entries on a Kanban board, we will be ordering these entries based on their priority and complexity. Since every task may not require the same effort, we will be assigning a *size* to each entry as they are created, in order to measure and compare efforts across individual tasks.

During each meeting and at the end of the iteration, we will study our weekly throughput graphs generated by Waffle, which quantify work completion by aggregating the *size* of all tasks that were completed during given week(s). We will also be referring to the current position of each task on the Kanban board and the time since they were created in order to judge our standing on pending work.

Individual contribution / progress will be evaluated based on the aggregate *size* of tasks completed by a given member during a given week.

## Product

### Goals and tasks

__1) Develop the following screens, which exhibit the primary features of our application:__

 * __*Discover* page__ - which shows both a list and a map view of nearby events. This will be the home screen of the application.
 * __*Sign in* / *Sign up* page__
 * __*Create Event* page__
 * __*Event Details* page__ - which shows complete details about an event and allows the user to indicate their interest towards an event
 * __*Create / Join Communities* page__


__2) Implement the following RESTful APIs using mock (hardcoded) data:__

 * SignIn and SignUp
 * CreateEvent
 * GetNearbyEvents
 * GetEventDetails

__3) Setup Database Server:__

 * Write a SQL script for creating the schema based on the [schema design](designs/schema_design_v1.md)
 * Integrate necessary NodeJS modules to establish connectivity with database server.

__4) Integrate RESTful APIs mentioned in (3) with database:__

 * Write appropriate SQL queries for querying / modifying data
 * Add any business logic required to process or further filter the data.

__5) Implement the following screens, which are *nice to haves* for the demo video:__

 * __*Event chat* page__ - which allows users planning to attend an event to chat amongst each other
 * __*Invites* Page__ - which enables a user to invite other users to communities, and also to view their list of pending invites from other users

### Artifacts

* __Front end:__ Upload device screenshots of all the screens that have been completed into the [screenshots](iteration2-artifacts/screenshots) directory in our Git repository.

* __Back end__: Run the [RESTful APIs tests](../server_dev/test) and verify that all of them are passing without any errors or warnings. Upload the test results as two `.txt` files (on for each of the test collections) into [REST-API-Test-Results](iteration2-artifacts/REST-API-Tests) directory.

* __Demo Build__: Upload a working and stable build (Android or iOS) that can be installed and run on a physical device. This is the build that will be used in the demo video. Build is to be uploaded in the [iteration2-artifacts](iteration2-artifacts) directory.

* __Demo Video__: Upload a demo video in the [iteration2-artifacts](iteration2-artifacts) directory, and verify that it meets the following requirements:

  * Total length is maximum 3 minutes (can be 5-6 seconds longer / shorter).
  * The narration is clear and audible.
  * Includes subtitles or text that highlights keywords.
  * Contains an introduction of about 30-45 seconds giving the audience some context about what our app addresses / solves.
  * Demonstrates the product by presenting the most common user flow(s) (roughly between 1.5 and 2 minutes).
  * Concludes the demo by summarizing what was presented and a brief discussing about our plans ahead.
